## Specifications and Limitations

### Search
The search is only in-browser, i.e., this will only search from the services available to the frontend.

### Pagination
The current home page does not have a pagination feature, one can be implemented using observation ref.

### Payment Verification
The current version assumes all payment methods will need only a OTP, which might not be the case, each payment method will have a different flow.

### No discount coupon
The current version does not implements any way to add a discount coupon.

### Analytics and Services Data
Currently the analytics and services data is taken from a data folder, this will be needed to changed once we have a backend in place.
